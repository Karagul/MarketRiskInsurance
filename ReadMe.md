# MarketRiskInsurance

This is a project compatible with LE2M.  

To run a session, connect the clients and load the current part (File menu and "load a part"). Change the directory where the data are stored (the data are stored in the MarketRiskInsurance's directory by default), and check (or uncheck) the "test" checkbox depending on whether this is a test or not.  

Once the clients are connected and the part is loaded, you can check the parameters (or change some of them) by clicking on the "display parameters" submenu. If everything is fine, and the subjects have read the instructions, you can start the part. To that purpose, just click on the MarketRiskInsurance menu and then on the "Start" submenu.

At the end of the part you can display the subjects's payoffs by clicking on the "display payoffs" submenu of the MarketRiskInsurance menu. Add the payoffs to the experiment's payoffs if those payoffs are part of the final payoff of subjects.
